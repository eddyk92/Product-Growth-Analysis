# SQL Practice for Growth & Product Analytics  
Using BigQuery Public Dataset: `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`

This repository contains SQL practice questions designed to simulate the type of work done by data analysts at high-growth startups like **Monarch Money**.  
The goal is to help refresh SQL skills across analytics, retention, growth, and product funnels using a real dataset available in Google BigQuery.

Key tables:
- `users`
